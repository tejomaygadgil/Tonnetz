# Das Tonnetz üç©

This is my implementation of [Neo-Riemannian chord progressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Riemannian_theory) using the [Tonnetz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonnetz) (tone network) as discovered by Leonhard Euler.

## Getting Started

Run 0116.py.

### Prerequisites

To fully utilize this code, you will need: 

```
rtmidi
```

This package will convert the notes to MIDI. The rest is up to you.

Hi there! This is my implementation of Neo-Riemannian chord triads (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Riemannian_theory). It's a work in progress, so feel free to reach out if you have any questions or suggestions. Let's have some fun :)

## Getting Started

Run 0116.py.

### Prerequisites

To fully utilize this code, you will need: 

```
rtmidi
```

This package will convert the notes to MIDI. The rest is up to you - Godspeed.
